<p class="lead">Research [2 hours]</p>

<p>A requirements engineering plan should focus on what you want to know. Think of the questions and claims that are important in this project. Identify which questions you have already answered, to what extent, and how reliable that answer is. Then plan what questions you want to have answered for this and next week and how you will get the answer. Make sure the answers to these questions are important to the main stakeholders. For the claims: which could you refute? </p>

<p>Questions could be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How does a DLO impact quality of learning?</li>
    <li>How does a DLO impact the organization of learning? : what would happen if we choose not to use a new DLO - who will suffer, what will go wrong more and why?</li>
    <li>What characteristics of users and usage are important to consider for the selection of a new system?</li>
    <li>Which type of usability problems will lead to problems in education (make it SMART)?</li>
    <li>Which type of usability problems might be annoying but have no impact on education?</li>
</ul>
<p>Claims you could try to refute:</p>
<ul>
    <li>More and better use of educational tools will improve education.</li>
    <li>If the DLO will make educational tools easy to apply, these will be applied more in the classroom.</li>
    <li>A stratified use of Blackboard will improve student satisfaction.</li>
    <li>A stratified use of Blackboard will improve study behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Prepare co-creation [2 hours]</p>

<p>In the workshop from this week we will discuss some techniques to co-create (design in this case) a new system. You will have to do a co-creation session next week. Please prepare for this. Activities: read, learn, plan. Output: a script for the co-creation session.</p>
