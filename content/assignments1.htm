<h3> Group Assignment 1 <small> Due on Sunday 2 October. </small><span class="label label-success"> Submitted </span> </h3>

<p>Make a concrete task model for two courses that are quite different in nature. Do this from the perspective of student tasks in these courses. Concrete: your model should present reflect the course items as concretely as possible, making it very specific for the course you model. For every task identify the actual and desired use of blackboard. </p> 

<p> Clearly account for the sources of your data. And clarify to what extent the data has been checked. </p>

<p> To gather data you will conduct at least three video-recorded interviews. Make sure that what is said, is intelligible. </p>

The video will be deleted after the course, and will not be distributed."</li>
