<h3> Group Assignment 1 <small> Due on Sunday 2 October. </small><span class="label label-success"> Submitted </span> </h3>

<p>Make a concrete task model for two courses that are quite different in nature. Do this from the perspective of student tasks in these courses. Concrete: your model should present reflect the course items as concretely as possible, making it very specific for the course you model. For every task identify the actual and desired use of blackboard. </p> 

<p> Clearly account for the sources of your data. And clarify to what extent the data has been checked. </p>

<p> To gather data you will conduct at least three video-recorded interviews. Make sure that what is said, is intelligible. </p>

<p> For the workshop prepare to show one minute of interviewing, clearly showing the interviewer and the interviewee. That minute can be one fragment, or a montage of several fragments. Show some situations you want to get feedback about. </p>

<p> Publish the recordings of the complete interviews and the one minute selection on your website, and provide us with the login credentials. </p>

<p> <strong> DON”T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON MONTAGE!!! </strong> </p>

<p>Getting started with interviewing. Goal of this week is get familiar with interviewing.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Conduct your interviews without any preparation.</li>
    <li>You may interview any person you like, but at least one you don't know.</li>
    <li>Approach the candidate with an opening sentence like: "Is it OK if I ask you some questions for an assignment of my course? It will take no more than 5 minutes. It is about the replacement of Blackboard. I've been asked to record our interview on video to get feedback on my interviewing technique. The video will be deleted after the course, and will not be distributed."</li>
    <li>Ask questions for your own sense making like: "Do you use Blackboard often?", “Do you like Blackboard?”, “What is good about it?“, “What do you not like about it?“</li>
    <li>Ask questions for data acquisition like: "What courses did you do last block before summer?" "How were they organized?" "Did you have to do labs?"</li>
    <li>Reflect with your partner.</li>
    <li>Log interesting findings and effective questions.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Reading Assignment 1 <small> Due on Wednesday 5 October. </small> <span class="label label-success"> Submitted </span> </h3>

<p class="lead">This week's theme: Getting started</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are for this assignment the obvious sources of information to find requirements and make sense of your assignment.</li>
    <li>Identify at least two important questions to drive the requirements engineering project for the new DLO. (if you have the answer to that question, you can derive the requirements almost intuitively) </li>
    <li>Plan your requirements activities for the first four weeks. Provide a short rationale, referring to the documents you have read. </li>
    <li>Based on the thesis of Nisha Jacob and your first interviews: identify the things you want to learn in interviewing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ad 1 and 2 The first phase of any requirements is that of orientation: talking to people, making sense of what needs to be done. Given the amount of information available in even the smallest projects, it’s an illusion to study everything. The success of a requirements project is depending to quite some extent to the information we acquire and examine. </p>

<p>But how do we make the right selection? We like to see that we do this in a planned and controlled way, that we act as rational decision makers. Among others Klein, Weick and Kahneman showed that this is an illusion. We process information that is readily available. Even if for our problem it would have been better to consult other sources. </p>

<p>Learning to become a good requirements engineer is to learn to master your information acquisition process. You cannot fight nature: we have limited cognitive abilities. But we need to build complementary skills and repeatedly spent time to consciously consider if we are doing the right things. </p>

<p>Ad 3 Make this a short plan. Identify stakeholders and personas for this specific case. Base your plan on the requirements activities described in Van Lamsweerde and in Contextual Design, but be sure to make it case specific. I expect you to refer clearly to the reading material. </p>

<p>Plan can be short (1 page), but it should contain some clear choices, as you have limited time for this case. Provide good rationale for your choices.</p>
